The project is an OCR based receipt reading program. 

The project identifies corners and crops. The functions are written but the functions are not called in the code. You can call if you want.

You do not need to download an additional JAR file that was installed with the required libraries Maven. You can use Apache Netbeans 11.1 as your IDE.

The project is in English, but some parts are named Turkish in the UI section. With a simple translate you can translate to any language. In Main you need to contact the database.

For Tesseract, you must provide the file path of the tessdata folder. There are tur.traineddata as Tesseract language, you can change it to any language.
